## 🥤 Introduction

**Don't let things go pear-shaped!** 🍐

Welcome to the **Juicy Guessing Game**, a sleek Python CLI implementation of the classic word guessing mechanism. Your goal is simple: uncover the hidden fruit name letter by letter before you die. 

It’s simple, it’s addictive, and it’s full of fiber.

## 🎮 How to Play

The game will present you with a series of dashes representing a secret fruit.
`_ _ _ _ _` (5 letters)

1.  **Run the script.**
2.  **Type a letter** (e.g., 'a') and hit Enter.
3.  **Watch the magic:**
    * If you are right: `_ A _ A _`
    * If you are wrong: You LOSE.
